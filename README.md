## Ignored Files

The `.gitignore` file is configured to prevent certain files and directories generated by Maven and IDEs from being committed to the Git repository.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following RESTful endpoints:

- `GET /loja/ProdutosDisponiveis`: Retrieves a list of all available products.
- `POST /loja/SolicitarOrcamento`: Allows the client to request a quote for a list of items.
- `GET /loja/EfetivarOrcamento`: Finalizes the quote and proceeds with the order given a specific quote ID.
- `GET /loja/GerarRelatorio`: Generates a report for the store's activities.

All endpoints support cross-origin requests from any domain.

## Building and Running

To build and run the application, use the provided Maven wrapper. The following command will compile the code and start the Spring Boot application:

```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This command is for Unix/Linux/Mac. Windows users should use `mvnw.cmd` instead.
